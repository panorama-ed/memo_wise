  # Though GitHub's documentation mostly says you only need this for reusable
  # workflows (i.e. workflows that call other workflows), it seems that GitHub
  # does not pass secrets to `pull_request` events that come from forks (which
  # it seems Dependabot's PRs do?) unless they are explicitly passed through,
  # because they do not want a forker's PR to be able to exfiltrate secret data
  # from the forked repo. This behavior is not really documented with respect to
  # Dependabot but some hints are here:
  # - https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#using-secrets-in-a-workflow
  # - https://github.com/pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish/discussions/49
