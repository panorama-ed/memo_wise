# This workflow removes a "Needs QA" label from a PR when the actor is the
# dependabot user merging a PR.
#
# We need this mechanism to allow for automerging whitelisted dependencies while
# also allowing for blocking a merge to master for deployment (in the way that
# our other PRs work). When the automerge script runs in henchman, it looks
# for `Needs QA` on github pull requests, and if the label is present,
# blocks the commit from merging.
